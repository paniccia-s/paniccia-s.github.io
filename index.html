					<h4>MIDI Drum Pad</h4>
					<!-- <h3>This part of the site is a <b>Work in Progress</b>- I'll be done with it soon!</h3>
					<h5><br><br>A sneak-peek of what we're working on...</h5>
					<img src="assets/images/drumpad.png" class="hoverable responsive-img"> -->
					<p>The <b>MIDI Drum Pad</b> is a collaborative project aimed to aid music composers in writing percussion parts on music-writing software like Logic and Garage Band. The final product will contain a fully-responsive playing surface that plays and feels like a normal practice pad. Every hit will be detected by the pad, processed by the on-board Teensy LC microprocessor, and sent through a USB port to the host computer as a MIDI signal. The channel and range of this outgoing signal can be selected through a series of buttons and a rotary encoder on the top of the pad for ease of use. The board features a PCB and signal processing code of our own design.
					<br><br><b>Language:</b> Arduino
					<br><br><b>Started:</b> March, 2018
					<br><br><b>Why?</b> My friend/composing partner, 
					<a href="https://joshuaberlin.me/">Josh</a>, and I were running into problems when composing percussion parts for our pieces. It was too hard to accurately record the rhythmically-intense parts without playing them on a drum. This project aims to remedy our problems by allowing us to record the parts exactly how we would play them on a real drum.

					<h4>Darwin's Playground</h4>
					<p><b>Darwin's Playground</b> is an evolutionary simulation in which organisms are mutated, bred, and placed into a world where their survival is based off of how well they were genetically engineered.
					<br><br><b>Language:</b> Java
					<br><br><b>Started:</b> October, 2017
					<br><br><b>Why?</b> I really like biology, and I really like programming. This project is a fun and challenging way to combine the two. Additionally, I wanted to sharpen my skills in Java, as I hadn't had much practice lately. 
					<br><br><b>What was the inspiration?</b> I was doodling in class one day and the pieces just sort of came together in my head. I said, "hey, wouldn't it be cool if I could create these organisms that live and die by their genetic code?". And then I remembered that yes, I probably indeed could do that. And here we are.

					<h4>Haiku Generator</h4>
					<i>I enjoy haikus</i><br>
					<i>They are really not that hard</i><br>
					<i>See, here's one right now!</i><br><br>
					<p>The <b>Haiku Generator</b> is a new project utilizing webscraping libraries to generate less-than-random haikus, following its signature 5-7-5 syllable pattern. Its first stage includes webscraping word syllable data off of 
						<a href="http://www.dictionary.com">www.dictionary.com</a>. This data is stored with the word in question in a text dictionary, and words are read and placed randomly to fit the 5-7-5 style. 
					<br><br><b>Language:</b> Python
					<br><br><b>Started:</b> February, 2018
					<br><br><b>Why?</b> Haikus are really fun, and so is learning a new programming language (fun fact about me: I can speak in haikus off the top of my head, which is probably the least useful ability one could possibly have). 
					<br><br><b>What was the inspiration?</b> A friend emailed me <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-scrape-websites-with-python-and-beautifulsoup-5946935d93fe">an article about webscraping</a> and I figured I should give it a try.

					<p><b>EventMo</b> is an event-planning Android app that facilitates communication and payment between host and guest. It includes a general discussion board where users can post messages to everyone, an announcements tab where the host can pin important announcements for all to see, and a balance section for calculating who owes what to whom (a detail that can get mighty messy as event size increases!)
					<br><br><b>Language:</b> Java (in Android Studio)
					<br><br><b>Started:</b> Summer of 2017
					<br><br><b>Why?</b> Managing events is a huge hassle and we wanted to do something about it. I, along with three friends, decided to try to make an app that could facilitate our event planning. It provided for us a good basic introduction into Android app development (and gave us something to do during the boring summer stretch).

I've always had a strong interest in the world around me, and I love solving problems and applying what I've learned to the real world. In my senior year of high school, I also discovered a love for designing and implementing programs, and voilà, the CE/CS major was born. Ever since then, I've always been tinkering away with personal projects on both the hardware and software side. Some of the more recent and major ones are below and on my GitHub page!

I've been a musician all my life, and music is essential to me. I've been an avid percussionist for almost 12 years, and I've performed everywhere from my high school auditorium to Main Street at Disney World in Florida. In my senior year of high school, I performed an 8-minute long marimba duet with a close friend of mine, and this fostered my love for pitched instruments. In the following two years I've self-taught guitar, bass guitar, piano, and flute, learning from and jamming with my roommates and friends (in my five-person apartment, we have 7 guitars, one ukulele, and one piano!). And all the while, I've continued to study and perform (and compose for!) percussion. I'm thrilled to have found such a rich musical environment at school!</p>

My all-time favorite groups are Pink Floyd, the Vince Guaraldi Trio (the Charlie Brown music guys!), and Vulfpeck. </p>

						<p>At the beginning of the spring semester of 2017, the conductor of the Northeastern Wind Ensemble held a chamber concert, and the percussion section had nothing to play. With the concert just a few weeks away, we had to find a piece to play.
						<br><br>But we found nothing. All of the pieces we found for five players were either boring, cliché, or just not good.
						<br><br><b>So we decided to write something of our own.</b> In February of 2017, fellow Wind Ensemble percussionist Joshua Berlin and I decided to compose a piece for percussion quintet to perform at the concert. I'd never composed before, but Josh convinced me to give it a try. 
						<br><br><b>We're still composing today.</b>
